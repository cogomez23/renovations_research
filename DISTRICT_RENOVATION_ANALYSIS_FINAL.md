## Phase 1: Premium Comp Definition

### Regression Model Performance
- **R-squared: 0.777** - Model explains 77.7% of rent variation
- **Rent Formula**: $773 + $0.71/sqft + $94/bedroom
- **Dataset**: 2,686 leased units across 15 properties (excluding NOVEL Daybreak)

### Premium Properties Identified (Above Regression Line)
Properties exceed regression expectations with >50 lease statistical reliability:

| Property | Premium Amount | Actual Rent | Predicted Rent | Lease Count |
|----------|---------------|-------------|----------------|-------------|
| **Parc Ridge** | **+$135** | $1,748 | $1,612 | 123 |
| **San Tropez Apartments** | **+$129** | $1,863 | $1,734 | 166 |
| **Soleil Lofts** | **+$83** | $1,709 | $1,625 | 190 |
| **VIDA at Daybreak** | **+$67** | $1,562 | $1,495 | 293 |
| **Hamilton Crossing** | **+$59** | $2,161 | $2,103 | 72 |
| **Meadows at Park Avenue** | **+$45** | $1,876 | $1,832 | 93 |
| **Upper West** | **+$38** | $1,526 | $1,488 | 158 |

## Phase 2: District Current Position

### District Performance Analysis
- **Current residual**: +$24 above regression line
- **Actual rent**: $1,585
- **Predicted rent**: $1,561 (based on fundamentals)
- **Statistical sample**: 164 leases in dataset
- **Status**: Already performing above market expectations

### Mathematical Rent Gap
- **Average premium comp residual**: $62 (top 10 properties above regression)
- **District current residual**: +$24
- **Mathematical difference**: $39/month potential increase

## Phase 3: 7% ROI Analysis

### Budget Calculation (Factual Math)
- **Potential monthly increase**: $39
- **Annual rent increase**: $39 ร 12 = $468
- **Maximum renovation budget (7% ROI)**: $468 รท 0.07 = $6,686 per unit
- **Actual renovation budget**: $6,500 per unit
- **Actual ROI on $6,500 investment**: $468 รท $6,500 = **7.2%**
- **Budget assessment**: Exceeds 7% minimum ROI threshold

### Dataset Lease Volume Context
- **Premium properties (10 total)**: 1,587 leases in dataset
- **District**: 164 leases in dataset
- **Dataset ratio**: 9.7:1 premium-to-District lease count
- **District's dataset share**: 10.3% of premium + District leases

*Important: This represents lease counts in dataset only, not market capacity or velocity*

## Critical Data Limitations

### Data We Did Not Consider or Missing
- Vacancy rates and time-to-lease data
- Temporal information (when leases occurred)
- Concession details (effective vs. gross rents)
- Property condition or recent renovation status
- Amenity inventories or location quality factors
- Lease terms (length, renewal rates)

### Analysis Constraints
- **Regression model limitations**: Only accounts for bedrooms + square footage
- **Dataset snapshot**: No market dynamics or trends
- **Unknown variables**: Property age, condition, amenities significantly impact rent premiums
- **Lease count interpretation**: High counts could indicate demand OR high turnover

---

## Factual Findings Summary

### What We Know:
1. **District is not underperforming** - already $24 above regression expectations
2. **Limited mathematical upside** - $39/month potential based on premium comp average
3. **Sufficient renovation budget** - $6,686 budget within $6,500 renovation capacity
4. **Strong premium comp presence** - 7 properties with significant premiums and lease volume



---

## Preliminary Assessment

**RECOMMENDATION**: PROCEED WITH RENOVATIONS

**RATIONALE**: 
- District can achieve $39/month rent increase based on premium comp analysis
- 7% ROI threshold met with $6,686 renovation budget (within $6,500 capacity)
- Mathematical analysis supports renovation economics
- 7 premium comparables validate higher rent potential

---

## Methodology Note
Analysis based on linear regression using square footage and bedroom count as rent predictors. Premium properties identified as those consistently performing above regression expectations with statistical significance (>50 leases). All calculations represent mathematical relationships within dataset, not market projections.
