# District Renovation Analysis - Factual Report

## Executive Summary
Based on regression analysis of 2,686 leased units (excluding NOVEL Daybreak), District currently performs **$24 above market expectations** given its square footage and bedroom count. Mathematical analysis suggests limited renovation upside.

---

## Phase 1: Premium Comp Definition

### Regression Model Performance
- **R-squared: 0.777** - Model explains 77.7% of rent variation
- **Rent Formula**: $773 + $0.71/sqft + $94/bedroom
- **Dataset**: 2,686 leased units across 15 properties (excluding NOVEL Daybreak)

### Premium Properties Identified (Above Regression Line)
Four properties exceed regression expectations with >50 lease statistical reliability:

| Property | Premium Amount | Actual Rent | Predicted Rent | Lease Count |
|----------|---------------|-------------|----------------|-------------|
| **Parc Ridge** | **+$135** | $1,748 | $1,612 | 123 |
| **San Tropez Apartments** | **+$129** | $1,863 | $1,734 | 166 |
| **Soleil Lofts** | **+$83** | $1,709 | $1,625 | 190 |
| **VIDA at Daybreak** | **+$67** | $1,562 | $1,495 | 293 |

*Note: Additional properties above regression line but with lower premiums: Hamilton Crossing (+$59), Meadows at Park Avenue (+$45), Upper West (+$38)*

## Phase 2: District Current Position

### District Performance Analysis
- **Current residual**: +$24 above regression line
- **Actual rent**: $1,585
- **Predicted rent**: $1,561 (based on fundamentals)
- **Statistical sample**: 164 leases in dataset
- **Status**: Already performing above market expectations

### Mathematical Rent Gap
- **Average premium comp residual**: $62 (top 10 properties above regression)
- **District current residual**: +$24
- **Mathematical difference**: $39/month potential increase

---

## Phase 3: 7% ROI Analysis

### Budget Calculation (Factual Math)
- **Potential monthly increase**: $39
- **Annual rent increase**: $39 × 12 = $468
- **Maximum renovation budget (7% ROI)**: $468 ÷ 0.07 = **$6,686 per unit**
- **Budget assessment**: Insufficient for comprehensive renovations

### Dataset Lease Volume Context
- **Premium properties (10 total)**: 1,587 leases in dataset
- **District**: 164 leases in dataset
- **Dataset ratio**: 9.7:1 premium-to-District lease count
- **District's dataset share**: 10.3% of premium + District leases

*Important: This represents lease counts in dataset only, not market capacity or velocity*

## Critical Data Limitations

### Missing Data Elements
- ❌ **No vacancy rates** or time-to-lease data
- ❌ **No temporal information** (when leases occurred)
- ❌ **No concession details** (effective vs. gross rents)
- ❌ **No property condition** or recent renovation status
- ❌ **No amenity inventories** or location quality factors
- ❌ **No lease terms** (length, renewal rates)

### Analysis Constraints
- **Regression model limitations**: Only accounts for bedrooms + square footage
- **Dataset snapshot**: No market dynamics or trends
- **Unknown variables**: Property age, condition, amenities significantly impact rent premiums
- **Lease count interpretation**: High counts could indicate demand OR high turnover

## Factual Findings Summary

### What We Know:
1. **District is not underperforming** - already $24 above regression expectations
2. **Limited mathematical upside** - $39/month potential based on premium comp average
3. **Insufficient renovation budget** - $6,686 budget unlikely to achieve premium positioning
4. **Strong premium comp presence** - 4 properties with significant premiums and lease volume

### What We Cannot Determine:
1. **Actual market absorption capacity** - requires vacancy and timing data
2. **Leasing velocity** - requires time-series lease data
3. **Renovation feasibility** - depends on property condition and zoning
4. **Competitive response** - how market reacts to District improvements
5. **Amenity replication** - whether District can match premium comp features

---

## Preliminary Assessment

**FINDING**: District currently performs above fundamental expectations (+$24 residual) with limited renovation upside ($39/month) that does not support 7% ROI threshold ($6,686 budget insufficient).

**NEXT STEPS REQUIRED**:
- Property condition assessment to determine actual renovation costs
- Amenity gap analysis vs. premium comparables  
- Current market vacancy and absorption data
- Detailed financial modeling with multiple scenarios

## Methodology Note
Analysis based on linear regression using square footage and bedroom count as rent predictors. Premium properties identified as those consistently performing above regression expectations with statistical significance (>50 leases). All calculations represent mathematical relationships within dataset, not market projections.
